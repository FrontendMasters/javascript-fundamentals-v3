A. [Presentation on responsive images](https://github.com/FrontendMasters/fem-layout-2/blob/main/day-1-flexbox/6-responsive-images/responsive%20images.pdf): `<picture>`, `srcset`, `sizes`, responsive background images.

B. Jen will demonstrate [ResponsiveBreakpoints.com](https://www.responsivebreakpoints.com), which generates a suite of images and `srcset`/`sizes` code to use on your page.

She will also demonstrate the banner demo inside the site.

**REMEMBER**: `<picture>` means YOU decide which image displays when. `srcset`/`sizes` means the BROWSER decides - and it doesn't always decide what you think it should!

C. To our page, add a "featured print" and a "hero banner" section of the web page using the starting graphic and the screenshots provided.

Starting graphics include `hero.png` and `too-cool.jpg`. You will need to create additional versions of these images and write the code to include them in the site.

**SUGGESTED**: Use `<picture>` for the hero banner and `srcset`/`sizes` for the featured print.
