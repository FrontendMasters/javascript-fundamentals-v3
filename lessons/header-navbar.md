Let's move on to laying out the header of the web page. We can do this with one navigation bar that includes the logo. By using Flexbox to lay out the navbar, we can then move the logo around wherever we want it -- far left and inline with the navbar, in the center of the navigation, or on its own line, separate from the rest of the navigation.
