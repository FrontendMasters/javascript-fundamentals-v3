a. Add a "popular prints" section of the web page, just after "our mission". See the screenshots for how this should look. Captions for the photos include:

- Fork It Up (the fork)
- Eyeing You (the car)
- Let's Scoot (the vespa scooter)

b. If you have time, clean up the formatting, comments, spacing and alignment, etc, to make it portfolio-worthy!
